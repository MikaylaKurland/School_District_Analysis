# School_District_Analysis

This analysis is to provide a school district with averages of their standardised test pass rates in reading and math. This is being done in the wake of the discovery of a large-scale case of academic dishonesty effecting the ninth grade Thomas High School. All of the reported scores for this class were replaced with NaN values. Our analysis will be looking for differences between the "before" and "after" values of this NaN conversion.

Surprisingly, the total average values for reading annd math scores had very little fluctuation with the removal of the Thomas High School ninth grade class. The percentage passing values for math and reading, respectively, also had very little fluctuation, from 73.88052080673985 and 84.65151901965791 to 74.76039164018704 and 85.6596657108166. This shows that the aveages for the district were not greatly impacted by the falsified data. The overall passing grade increased after the change by less than a percentage point, which is not a significant change.
